A report and policy brief on where to place a new metro station in Medellín, Colombia.

This project represents my coursework for the course "Mathematics and Data Science for Development", taken at the University of Oxford. The objective was to find the optimal location for a new metro stop in Medellín to increase accessibility to lower-income city municipalities (and, on a more granular level, comunas). Data was provided on the city's metro network, commutes between different comunas, and demographics. 

My approach was to implement a "gravity model" for mobility in the city, to identify pairs of areas where many commutes "should" be taking place. I then compared this to the actual observed commute numbers to see where an additional metro stop could improve accessibility.

This repo contains two documents:
- `Mobility_report_Barbosa.pdf` is a technical report on the modelling and analysis;
- `policy_brief.pdf` is a short policy brief, hypothetically intended to be read by the municipality/city councils.
